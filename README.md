Template Repository for public Unicode projects


# Using

This is a private repo to be used as the legal template for certain Unicode repos. BEFORE CREATING ANY NEW REPO, please follow on the required process steps set forth in the [Policy & Process for New Repos, Repo Changes & Repo Transfers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ooG1C_0AB3gG9WkLSko-5kWFoLexBuvQbptti0MZv6E/edit) and then use the [Repository Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1AiNApxWEnkPkfxDXKWE0-8an2EKiq2zh7LZn7C1ZVwg/edit) to obtain approval of the proposed new repo. Please note, the same steps should be followed if you intend to make an existing private repo public or if you intend to transfer an external repo to Unicode.

Once a new repo is approved, this Template repo can be used as a template for new "Standard Public Repos" as set forth in the [Unicode Github Repositories Licensing Set-Up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k2AOhTLEE1UtkJeawND-8ZdmDvPvbSH0lj5ai2B-QMo/edit#gid=1408776897) spreadsheet. This template's legal language is only appropriate for repos that have been approved as "Standard Public Repos" - it should not be used for repos requiring non-standard legal language or using licenses other than the [Unicode License v3](https://www.unicode.org/license.txt). If you are unsure about whether to use this template or have other questions, consult with the Infrastructure Team and/or Unicode legal counsel.
